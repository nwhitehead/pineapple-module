pineapple-module
----------------

This project is a Python module that defines some utility
functions for the Pineapple IPython/Jupyter front-end.

The goal is to standardize notebooks so that notebook authors
can have a consistent and easy way for readers to reproduce their
exact results with the least amount of hassle.
